# by the end of this, this will just create an image
# after the image is created, then we still need to create the container
# by running "docker-compose up -d", this will run what is left here
# and that the "remote_host_ services and then this will create the container

# the "services" in this file will create a local DNS that will let other
# container communicate to each other
